# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this project is still in alpha phase, we will issue security updates via new releases from the `main` branch. 
This basically means that security fixes will simply be issued as new releases; no patched versions of previous releases will be created
until we reach `v1.0.0`.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by creating an issue and mark it with the `security` label. Expect an update within 2 business days.
This being a FOSS project, no bounty program currently exists unfortunately.
